## **Teaching Practice – Philosophy**

Kickstart's teaching philosophy is grounded in active, student-centered engagement and shaped by a strong commitment to openness, inclusivity, and responsibility—values reflected in both our daily practice and our shared Code of Conduct.

1. **We practice active teaching**, engaging with students in ways that best support their learning. This includes fostering a dynamic classroom environment that encourages curiosity, participation, and critical thinking. We recognize that students learn in diverse ways and tailor our approaches accordingly, always aiming to be inclusive and accommodating.
2. **We lead by example**, modelling openness, collaboration, and reflective practice. We embrace new tools and technologies, such as AI, with careful consideration and critical judgment. In doing so, we demonstrate responsible use of digital tools, encouraging students to engage with innovation while thinking ethically and analytically about its implications.
3. **We are always available to help, but also know when to step back**. Our role is to guide and support without removing opportunities for independent learning and peer discovery. We strive to cultivate confidence and agency in our students, encouraging them to take ownership of their learning while knowing support is accessible.
4. **We encourage open discussion and peer collaboration**, believing that shared dialogue, respectful disagreement, and diverse perspectives enhance learning. Our teaching spaces are built on mutual respect and inclusivity, where students feel welcome to share their views and learn from one another.

## Code of Conduct DIKU

**Open and Accommodating:** Being open and respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences.

**Inclusive:** Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community.

**Constructive**: Giving and accepting constructive feedback.

**Responsible**: Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience.

**Respectful:** Respecting DIKU facilities by following the current regulations of the Faculty of Sciencee and DIKU

- Welcome to DIKU. Our goal is to promote excellence in computer science education and research.
- To strive for a respectful, inclusive, diverse environment and encourage open and critical academic discussion.
- We strive to create a welcoming and respectful environment.

## Martin Toft Jensen's MSC project

In higher education, teaching assistants (TAs) play a vital role in supporting student learning during exercise and study sessions. However, these sessions often suffer from disorganization and inefficiencies: students may wait unproductively for help, TAs struggle to identify and prioritize student needs, and valuable teaching insights are often lost. While digital queue systems have been proposed or used informally in educational contexts (e.g., Google Docs), existing solutions are often limited in functionality, usability, or adoption. This thesis investigates how a virtual TA-help queue system can be designed, engineered, and evaluated to not only manage turn-taking and queuing, but also support decision-making and resource allocation for TAs. Drawing on explorative and ethnographic methods, user-centered design principles, and ethnographic practices, including an iterative prototyping software engine, the system will be co-designed with stakeholders and evaluated in an authentic educational setting. A central research question is: **How can an educational technology system be designed and engineered to support TAs in structuring help sessions, for example, by grouping students effectively, suggesting when to explain topics, and providing timely, relevant assistance, possibly enhanced by AI tools?**  This study aims to contribute to the design of usable educational software, a deeper understanding of TA¿student interaction patterns, and the evaluation of practical EdTech interventions in real-world learning environments.
